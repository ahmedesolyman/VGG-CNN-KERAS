# VGG-CNN-KERAS
Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks
In last week’s blog post we learned how we can quickly build a deep learning image dataset — we used the procedure and code covered in the post to gather, download, and organize our images on disk.

Now that we have our images downloaded and organized, the next step is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on top of the data.

I’ll be showing you how to train your CNN in today’s post using Keras and deep learning. The final part of this series, releasing next week, will demonstrate how you can take your trained Keras model and deploy it to a smartphone (in particular, iPhone) with only a few lines of code.

The end goal of this series is to help you build a fully functional deep learning app — use this series as an inspiration and starting point to help you build your own deep learning applications.

Let’s go ahead and get started training a CNN with Keras and deep learning.
